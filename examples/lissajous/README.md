# Parametric 2-dimension Lissajous curve spline fit

![2D Lissajous SplineCurve](https://harbik.github.io/img/dierckx/lissajous.png)

Here we fit a two-dimensional cubic spline using `CubicSplineFit2D` `smoothing_spline` fit method.
The input data is here generated from the `lissajous` function, which produces `x` and `y`-values from an input angle as parameter, and two harmonic functions.

```rust
fn lissajous(t:f64, a: f64, kx: f64, b: f64, ky: f64) -> [f64;2] {
    [
        a * (kx * t).cos(),
        b * (ky * t).sin()
    ]
}
```

A dataset is generated, with parameter `us`, by varying input angle `t` from 0 to 180ยบ, with steps of 1ยบ,
and an `xy` vector, containing corresponding  [x(t),y(t)] coordinates:
``` rust
    let us: Vec<f64> = (0..=180u32).into_iter().map(|v|(v as f64).to_radians()).collect();

    for t in &us {
        let [x,y] = lissajous(*t, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 5.0);
        xy.extend(&[x,y]);
        xx.push(x);
        yy.push(y);
    }
```
Also vectors `xx` and `yy` are generated here, which are used for plotting purposes, but are not needed otherwise.

The spline representation is calculated using:
```rust
    let s = CubicSplineFit2D::new(us.clone(), xy.clone())?
            .smoothing_spline(5e-3)?;
```
The inputs here are cloned, also to be able to reuse them for plotting; if you don't need a plot, clones are not needed.
The target accuracy ---as an rms error value--- of the spline fit is set to `5e-3`, or `0.005`;
with a smaller error the spline fit will be better, but will contain more control points.

With this precision, we the following spline representation, printed to the command line output as a JSON object:
```rust
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string_pretty(&s)?);
```
Here is the JSON output:

The `t` array contains the knot values, in this case in form of parameter `t` angles, in which the curve is split up for this fit: it's size is 19, including three repeats at the start, and three repeats at the end, which are needed for spline evaluation.
The `c` array contains the coordinates of 15 control points with their `x` values in the first 15 values, and their `y` values in the second set of 15 values.
The values `k` and `n` are the spline degree, for a cubic spline 3, and the dimension of the spline, in this case 2.
